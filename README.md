## Responsive Landing Page :

A vibrant, responsive landing page built with HTML and CSS, featuring a fixed navigation bar with always-visible menu items and a dynamic hero section. The design is modern and visually appealing, with a magenta-to-orange gradient hero, teal navigation bar, and coral pink accents for interactivity. The page is optimized for all screen sizes and includes smooth hover and scroll effects.

## Features

Fixed Navigation Bar: Always-visible menu items (Home, About, Services, Contact) with no collapsible hamburger menu, even on mobile devices.
Interactive Navigation: Navbar buttons feature coral pink hover effects (#ff6b6b), with a unique brighter coral (#ff8787) for the "About" link. The navbar transitions from semi-transparent teal (#006d77) to solid teal on scroll.

Vibrant Hero Section: A magenta-to-orange gradient (#c026d3 to #f97316) overlay on a colorful background image, with a subtle zoom effect on hover.

Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, with navbar items wrapping on smaller screens and scaled-down typography for mobile.

Modern Styling: Uses Poppins font, smooth animations, and a cohesive color palette (teal, coral pink, cream, dark gray).

Sections: Includes Home, About, Services (with a grid of cards), and Contact (with a form), each with distinct styling and hover effects.

Accessibility: High-contrast colors and required form attributes ensure usability.
